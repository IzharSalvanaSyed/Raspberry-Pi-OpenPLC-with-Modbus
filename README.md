## Introduction <a name="introduction">
In this Project, I will use a Raspberry Pi running OpenPLC to create a switch to turn on and off an LED. I will then use Modbus to control the PLC (Raspberry Pi) over the network. I will also use (insert program) to monitor the activity between Modbus and the PLC.

## Getting Started <a name="starting">
We will need a Raspberry Pi, a project breadboard, an LED, a couple of jump wires, a 220 ohm resistor, two push buttons, and a computer.

## Software installation <a name="software">
Let's start by installing the OpenPLC runtime, OpenPLC editor, and Radzio Modbus Master Simulator. Don't worry; it's straightforward.

We will need to install the OpenPLC editor on your computer, and you can follow the instructions for your operating system with this video.

We will need to install OpenPLC Runtime on our Raspberry Pi. The installation process is described in this video.

Radio Modbus Master Simulator is also very straightforward and does not require an installation as it runs as a portable program. The download link can be found here.
